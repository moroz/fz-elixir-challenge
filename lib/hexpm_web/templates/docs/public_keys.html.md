## Public keys

This page lists the public keys used by Hex.pm. Hex uses those public keys to guarantee developers can safely fetch the registry hosted by Hex.pm.

If you have been linked to this page from an error message, it means the public key that ships with your Hex client has been revoked. Below you can find up to date keys and instructions on how to install it for your client.

**Remember to only install public keys from sources you trust!**
