<div class="subtitle"><time datetime="2020-05-25T00:00:00Z">25 May, 2020</time> · by Eric Meadows-Jönsson</div>

Today we are publishing updates to our [Terms of Service](/policies/termsofservice) and [Code of Conduct](/policies/codeofconduct).

### Code of Conduct

The goal of the changes to the COC is to remove redundancies in the text and focus more on the positive rather than the negative. Instead of listing everything that is not allowed we focus on communicating the goal of the COC and the spirit of the kind of communication and conduct we expect from the community.

We are also limiting the scope of the COC to only govern the direct community surrounding Hex and to areas where we can effectively enforce it.

### Terms of Service

The changes to the Terms of Service can be summarized as:

  * Clarify Six Colors AB is the legal body behind Hex and operates Hex services
  * Added Private Content section about how Hex will handle customers private content, such as packages and documentation
  * User account sharing is not allowed, each person is required to only use their own Hex.pm account
  * Each person accessing an organization requires a paid seat

For the full changes see [this commit](https://github.com/hexpm/hexpm/commit/cb2d06a2b1da14471f3415106c9ea19875790f34).

The changes to the Terms of Service will go into effect 26 June, 2020. The changes to the Code of Conduct are effective immediately.
